## Project Status 
Current Status: `Work in progress`
I have created most of the user interface. With user-friendly, logical features. I have added the basic javascript, so the page responds to user interaction. 
I have built the functionality to finish the game and have a winner add the  logic to declare a loser.
 
* The Logic is flawed, you can continue clicking closed dooors and over-ride a loss to generate a win.
